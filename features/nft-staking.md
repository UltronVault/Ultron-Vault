# ðŸŸª NFT Staking

<mark style="background-color:red;">NFT staking</mark> is an investment modality in <mark style="background-color:red;">Ultron Vault</mark> that involves holding non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for a specific period of time in exchange for rewards in other cryptocurrencies or <mark style="background-color:red;">ULTRON</mark> tokens.

* By performing <mark style="background-color:red;">NFT staking,</mark> NFT holders lock their digital assets on a specific platform and, in return, receive an interest rate or other rewards, such as additional tokens or usage advantages on the platform.

#### Some benefits of NFT staking on Ultron Vault include:

* <mark style="background-color:red;">Passive earnings:</mark> By locking their NFTs on an NFT staking platform, holders can earn additional rewards without having to perform active trading or investment actions. This allows investors to obtain passive gains while their digital assets are held.
* <mark style="background-color:red;">Increase in NFT value:</mark> In many cases, NFT staking can increase the value of the NFT itself. This is because, by locking their NFTs, holders can reduce the available supply on the market, which can increase demand and, consequently, the value of the NFT.
* <mark style="background-color:red;">Participation in governance:</mark> Our NFT staking platform allows holders to participate in the platform's governance, voting on important decisions such as fee changes and reward distribution.

#### A numerical example of NFT staking:

On the <mark style="background-color:red;">Ultron Vault platform</mark>, NFT staking offers an interest rate of 5% per year for NFTs locked for a one-year period. Suppose an NFT holder locks an NFT worth $1,000 for one year. At the end of the staking period, the holder will receive $50 in rewards, in addition to the original value of the NFT. If the value of the NFT also increases during the staking period, the holder can obtain an even greater profit.
