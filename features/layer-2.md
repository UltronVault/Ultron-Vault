# ðŸŸª Layer 2

## Layer 2

* Layer 2 is a layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model that will be used by Ultron Vault, where we will provide reliable data communication services between devices connected to a local network. Here is the concept of Layer 2, as well as its benefits in Ultron Vault:

**`Concepts:`** Layer 2 provides reliable data communication services, such as media access control (MAC) and flow management, as well as supporting device addressing on the network. It is responsible for ensuring that data is sent and received correctly between devices on the same local network.

#### Benefits: Layer 2 has several benefits, including:

* [x] **Bandwidth efficiency:** Layer 2 allows multiple devices to share the same bandwidth on a local network, improving the efficiency of bandwidth usage.
* [x] **Reliability:** Layer 2 uses media access control (MAC) to ensure that data is sent and received correctly, reducing the chance of errors and interruptions in data communication.
* [x] **Scalability:** Layer 2 allows new devices to be easily added to a local network, allowing the network to grow as the company or organization grows.
* [x] **Security:** Layer 2 can be used to implement security features such as VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) to isolate traffic between devices and increase network security.
* [x] **Ease of management:** Layer 2 is relatively easy to manage and configure, allowing companies and organizations to implement and maintain local networks with ease.
