# Perpetual Futures

At <mark style="background-color:red;">Ultron Vault</mark>, we have adopted operations in perpetual cryptocurrency futures. These operations are becoming increasingly popular among cryptocurrency investors and offer a number of <mark style="background-color:red;">benefits over traditional futures.</mark>

* [x] Firstly, perpetual futures allow investors to hold positions for an indefinite period of time, without a defined expiration date. This is very different from traditional futures, which have a fixed expiration date, which can be limiting for investors who wish to hold long-term positions.
* [x] In addition, perpetual futures will be traded on our Ultron Vault exchange, which means that investors can trade them easily and quickly. This also means that investors have access to a wide range of trading pairs, which can help diversify their investment portfolios.

Another advantage of <mark style="background-color:red;">perpetual futures</mark> is that they generally have a funding rate for keeping positions open for an extended period of time. This rate can be positive or negative, depending on market demand, which means that investors can profit from this rate if they know how to trade wisely.

#### To better understand how perpetual futures work, let's give an example.

* Suppose you want to trade Bitcoin perpetual futures with a 10x leverage. You decide to open a long position of 1 BTC at a price of $50,000. The initial margin required is 10%, which means you need to deposit $5,000 to open the position.
* Now, suppose the price of Bitcoin rises to $55,000 and you decide to close the position. You made a profit of $5,000 in the trade, which is a 100% return on the initial margin. However, if the price of Bitcoin falls to $45,000, you will have a loss of $5,000 in the trade, which represents a 100% loss on the initial margin.
* Ultron Vault's perpetual futures are an interesting option for cryptocurrency investors who want to hold long-term positions and diversify their investment portfolios.
