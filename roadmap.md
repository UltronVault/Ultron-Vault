#### Initial Phase&#x20;

* <mark style="background-color:red;">Creation of the initial project idea:</mark> The first step in any project is the creation of the initial idea. This involves brainstorming and research to determine the feasibility and potential of the idea, as well as identifying any potential challenges or obstacles that may arise.
* <mark style="background-color:red;">Alignment of all fronts and distribution of activities:</mark> Once the initial idea has been created, it is important to bring together all teams and stakeholders involved in the project to align and distribute activities. This includes assigning roles and responsibilities, establishing timelines and deadlines, and creating a plan of action for the project.
* <mark style="background-color:red;">Creation of social networks and corporate website:</mark> The next step is the creation of social media accounts and a corporate website to promote the project and engage with the community. This includes designing and developing the website, creating social media content, and implementing a marketing strategy to attract users and investors.
* <mark style="background-color:red;">Engagement with the BSC Mainnet ecosystem and marketing partnerships:</mark> To increase the visibility and success of the project, it is essential to engage with the BSC Mainnet ecosystem and establish partnerships with other projects and marketing partners. This includes identifying potential partners, negotiating agreements, and developing joint marketing campaigns to promote the project and increase its adoption.
* <mark style="background-color:red;">Community growth:</mark> Building a strong and engaged community is crucial for the success of any project. This involves creating engaging content, hosting events and giveaways, and fostering open communication with community members to build trust and loyalty.
* I<mark style="background-color:red;">nventory of resources and costs:</mark> Finally, it is important to take stock of all resources and costs associated with the project. This includes identifying the necessary funding, human resources, and technology needed to complete the project, as well as estimating the overall costs and creating a budget to ensure financial sustainability.

#### Second Phase

Integrating web app platforms with the development of bridge, decentralized exchange, perpetual decentralized swaps, and staking can be an effective way to enhance user experience and increase platform efficiency. Here are some steps that can be followed to achieve this integration:

* <mark style="background-color:red;">Bridge Development:</mark> The first step is the development of a bridge that can connect multiple platforms and allow asset transfer between them. This can be done through smart contracts, which allow platforms to interact with each other in a secure and reliable manner. \
  <mark style="background-color:red;">Benefits:</mark> This integration can help increase liquidity, allowing users to exchange their assets across multiple platforms without the need for conversion. Additionally, it can reduce transaction fees and improve overall platform efficiency.
* <mark style="background-color:red;">Decentralized Exchange</mark>: The next step is the development of a decentralized exchange that can enable direct asset exchange without the need for intermediaries. This can be done using smart contracts, which can automatically execute transactions. \
  <mark style="background-color:red;">Benefits</mark>: This integration can help reduce transaction fees, eliminate intermediaries, and allow users to exchange assets more quickly and efficiently.
* <mark style="background-color:red;">Perpetual Decentralized Swaps:</mark> Perpetual decentralized swaps are a form of trading that allows users to hold positions for longer periods of time. This integration can be done through smart contracts, which allow users to hold positions for longer periods of time. \
  <mark style="background-color:red;">Benefits:</mark> This integration can help increase liquidity, enable users to exchange assets for longer periods of time, and reduce the need for intermediaries.
* <mark style="background-color:red;">Staking:</mark> Staking is a form of investment that involves locking assets to help maintain network security and stability. This integration can be done through smart contracts, which allow users to lock their assets to receive rewards. \
  <mark style="background-color:red;">Benefits:</mark> This integration can help increase network security and stability, as well as provide a source of passive income for users.
* <mark style="background-color:red;">Partnership Search:</mark> Finally, one of the most important steps is to search for partnerships with other projects in the BSC ecosystem, such as DEXs, perpetual protocols, and Web3 projects. This can help increase platform visibility and expand its user base. \
  <mark style="background-color:red;">Benefits:</mark> This integration can help increase liquidity, efficiency, and security of the platform, as well as allow users to access a variety of additional resources and services.
